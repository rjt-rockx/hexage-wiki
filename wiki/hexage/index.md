# About Hexage

Hexage is a small independent game studio from Prague, Czech Republic, that has been making games since the early 2000s. Founded in January 2009 by [David Peroutka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidperoutka/?originalSubdomain=cz) and [Patrik Hoschl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-hoschl-a2bb625a/?originalSubdomain=cz), the studio began as two developers experimenting with game ideas and has maintained a small team approach that works well for their creative process.

Hexage games are known for their distinctive neon visual style and atmospheric soundtracks. Their signature glowing aesthetic originated in their first game [_Buka_](/buka/), where it was initially used as visual warnings around enemies, but became a defining characteristic of their games.

The studio develops games for Android, iPhone & iPad, Steam, Windows, Mac OS X, and a bunch of other platforms. Their games have achieved millions of downloads over the years.

## Development Approach

Hexage focuses exclusively on creating their own original games rather than client work. They prefer to develop something fresh and original rather than follow market trends, as they put it: "we don't make apps that desperately try to grab your attention by mimicking other trends."

Their development process typically starts with a gameplay concept, then builds the world and atmosphere around it. They incorporate quirky humor that creates interesting tonal contrasts - such as the cute animals in [_Everlands_](/everlands/) speaking like serious warriors from fantasy novels.

The studio achieved their first million downloads in 2010, which was significant for early mobile gaming. They prefer organic word-of-mouth promotion over aggressive marketing, believing that quality games naturally get shared when people want to show them to friends.

Their games draw inspiration from classic arcade experiences like _Space Invaders_, _Galaga_, and _Pac-Man_, while incorporating modern elements like RPG progression and deeper gameplay systems. They prioritize creating polished games with substance over quick releases - avoiding ads, data collection, and focusing on quality gaming experiences.

## Art
